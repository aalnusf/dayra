2,Culture,Grand mosque," Although there are more that 800 mosques in Kuwait, the Grand mosque is by far the most impressive and is a distinguished landmark in Kuwait. Not all mosques in Kuwait will allow tourist in, so this is a good opportunity to experience the Muslim religion. Guided tours lasting an hour can be arranged by calling in advance (tours are for two or more people), the tours are guided by an experienced guide that will tell you about the history of Islam and the mosque. Tours are in English and are open for males and females. Ladies will be asked to wear a scarf to cover their head (Hijab). If you have forgotten yours the mosque will provide you with one. When entering the mosque you need to remove your shoes and they will be safely placed outside in a shoe rack. This is definitely worth a visit if you have never been inside a mosque before.
